    <li>You will work with a partner to make investment decisions.</li>
    <li>You can communicate with your partner <strong>only</strong> through the chat. External discussion is not allowed.</li>
    <li>Your group will have a shared success number for each round.</li>
    <li>Participants will equally share the profits or losses that your group achieves from the investment.</li>
    <li>Use the slider to choose the investment amount after discussing it with your partner.</li>
    <li>Once you have agreed on an investment amount, click the "Agree on Investment" button.</li>
    <li>After one player "Agrees on Investment", the other player can finalize the investment amount.</li>
